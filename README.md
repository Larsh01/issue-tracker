# Unofficial Public Issue Tracker for the MWO Community

Given the limited reources of a company as small as PGI, the intended purposes of this issue tracker are:
1. To serve as a crowd-sourced transparent way to record bugs as well as small-to-medium QoL (Quality of Life) suggestions in a central and organized way, distinct from the existing subreddits and forum.
2. To indicate to PGI, via the number of issue-upvotes, how to prioritize bug fixes.
3. To indicate to PGI, via the number of issue-upvotes, how to prioritize QoL suggestions.
