**Greetings fellow MechWarriors,**

As a software engineer and a long time fan of MechWarrior, I decided to contribute to MWO in the most effective way I know how... maintaining a public, community-voted Issue Tracker right here on GitHub. For a more in-depth answer, please read [Why Does This Issue Tracker Exist?](https://github.com/MechWarriorOnline/issue-tracker/wiki/Why) and [Goals And Non-Goals](https://github.com/MechWarriorOnline/issue-tracker/wiki/Goals).

I encourage you to look through the list of issues and upvote any that resonate with you.

Cheers,  
`    ` `tauSentry`

## Goals
Given the limited reources of a company as small as PGI, the intended purposes of this issue tracker are:
1. To serve as a public, crowd-sourced, bug-tracker to record __*bugs of any size*__.
2. To indicate to PGI, via the number of upvotes, the community's desire for how to prioritize bug fixes.
3. To collect very specific __*small-to-medium QoL (Quality of Life) enhancements/features*__ in a central and organized way. This is intended to be distinct from the existing subreddits and forum which tend towards larger, flashier, or controversial features - and all of the complaining that goes along with them.
    * By "Quality of Life" I mean one of two things:
      1. Minor annoyances in the UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) that annoy you every time you encounter it.  
      2. Minor potential changes that most users don't know they want, but upon seeing it might say, "Ohhhh, that's so much better!" or "How did I live without this?!"

    * A decent metric for "small-to-medium" is: "Would this take PGI devs just a few days (1 week max) to implement?"... as compared to, for example, the New Skill Tree which has been in the works for a very long time.
4. To indicate to PGI, via the number of upvotes, the community's desire for how to prioritize enhancements and features.

## Non-Goals... i.e. What this issue tracker is NOT:
* A place for salt.
* Balance issues, e.g. "Inner Sphere has been buffed to god-like status. Restore the balance, Russ!"
* Pie-in-the-sky feature requests, e.g. "200-ton Mechs plz!"
* Overly general issues, e.g. "MatchMaker is broken, plz fix. k thx bye"
* Bashing of any kind - e.g. against PGI devs, and especially against specific players or units.
