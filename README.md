# Unofficial Public Issue Tracker for the MWO Community

The intended purpose of this issue tracker is to serve as a crowd-sourced way to record bugs and QoL (Quality of Life) suggestions, and to track the progress of bugfixes. This will be a supplement to the existing method of reporting bugs and QoL suggestions directly to PGI (Piranha Games Inc), the make of MechWarrior Online.
