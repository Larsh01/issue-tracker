*STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

# Unofficial Public Issue Tracker for the MWO Community

## Goals of this issue tracker
Given the limited reources of a company as small as PGI, the intended purposes of this issue tracker are:
1. To serve as a crowd-sourced, objective, transparent means to record bugs as well as very specific small-to-medium QoL (Quality of Life) suggestions in a central and organized way, distinct from the existing subreddits and forum.
2. To indicate to PGI, via the number of issue-upvotes, how to prioritize bug fixes.
3. To indicate to PGI, via the number of issue-upvotes, how to prioritize QoL suggestions.
  
  
## What this issue tracker is NOT:
* A place for salt
* Bashing of any kind - be it against PGI, specific players, etc.
* Balance issues, e.g. IS vs Clan
* Pie-in-sky feature requests, e.g. "200-ton Mechs plz!"
* Overly general issues, e.g. "MatchMaker is broken, plz fix. k thx bye"
