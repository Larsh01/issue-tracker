*STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

# Unofficial Public Issue Tracker for the MWO Community

## Given the limited reources of a company as small as PGI, the intended purposes of this issue tracker are:
1. To serve as a crowd-sourced, objective, transparent means to record bugs as well as small-to-medium QoL (Quality of Life) suggestions in a central and organized way, distinct from the existing subreddits and forum.
2. To indicate to PGI, via the number of issue-upvotes, how to prioritize bug fixes.
3. To indicate to PGI, via the number of issue-upvotes, how to prioritize QoL suggestions.



## How to Upvote an issue:
* Select the Thumbs-Up option from the Reactions menu, [shown here](http://lauhakari.com/content/uploads/2016/03/github_reactions.png):

## What this is NOT:
* A place for salt
* Balance issues
* Bashing of any kind - be it against PGI, specific players, etc.
