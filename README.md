# Unofficial Public Issue Tracker for MechWarrior Online
  
---
  
## Goals
Given the limited reources of a company as small as PGI, the intended purposes of this issue tracker are:
1. To serve as a public, crowd-sourced, bug-tracker to record __*bugs of any size*__.
2. To indicate to PGI, via the number of upvotes, the community's desire for how to prioritize bug fixes.
3. To collect very specific __*small-to-medium QoL (Quality of Life) enhancements/features*__ in a central and organized way. This is intended to be distinct from the existing subreddits and forum which tend towards larger, flashier, or controversial features - and all of the complaining that goes along with them.
    * By "Quality of Life" I mean one of two things:
      1. Minor annoyances in the UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) that annoy you every time you encounter it.  
      2. Minor potential changes that most users don't know they want, but upon seeing it might say, "Ohhhh, that's so much better!" or "How did I live without this?!"

    * A decent metric for "small-to-medium" is: "Would this take PGI devs just a few days (1 week max) to implement?"... as compared to, for example, the New Skill Tree which has been in the works for a very long time.
4. To indicate to PGI, via the number of upvotes, the community's desire for how to prioritize enhancements and features.

## Non-Goals... i.e. What this issue tracker is NOT:
* A place for salt.
* Balance issues, e.g. "Inner Sphere has been buffed to god-like status. Restore the balance, Russ!"
* Pie-in-the-sky feature requests, e.g. "200-ton Mechs plz!"
* Overly general issues, e.g. "MatchMaker is broken, plz fix. k thx bye"
* Bashing of any kind - e.g. against PGI devs, and especially against specific players or units.

## Why? (Part 1)
Given the limited reources (a.k.a. developer time) in a company as small as PGI, the company needs to prioritize developer tasks. Speaking as a software engineer myself, this is not a simple thing to do. Many factors come into play, including appeasement of the user-base. That particular problem is even more difficult when trying to cater to only the most vocal users  in Russ' Twitter stream, or in the (salt) forum, or on the subreddits ([/r/mwo](https://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/) and [/r/OutReachHPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG/)) about large, difficult-to-address issues (e.g. Balance, P2W, etc.) that are always bound to make half of the player-base angry. This issue tracker is instead geared towards *un*controversial "low-hanging fruit" that can make a positive and noticeable difference in the day-to-day experiences of nearly all players, yet be simple enough for PGI to implement quickly. In other words, the QoL issues that should be listed here should give the most bang (i.e. player satisfaction) for the buck (i.e. dev resources). PGI has an opportunity here to easily generate some much-needed goodwill in the player-base (i.e. us).
* For examples of this, see some of the QoL issues I created.

## Why? (Part 2)
As a software engineer, I cringe when I see certain bugs that should never have made it past QA (Quality Assurance). Yes, I'm talking about the Dropship bugs, among others. I then cringe yet again after patches are released, when I see that those bugs are *still* there. I believe that MWO is sending the wrong message to both new and veteran players alike by allowing non-obscure bugs to remain in production. Why would we have faith in yet-to-be-released features if the *old* features still have bugs? Why should potential-MWO-players take MWO seriously if it has so many glaring bugs? It is my hope that by using an organized, community-voted, bug-tracking system that the MWO community can constructively help guide PGI to better focus its efforts.

## How to know if it's appropriate to comment on an issue:
* Only add a comment to an issue if:
    * It is objectively relevant to the issue.
        * Opinions are best expressed here by upvoting or downvoting, *not* through comments. Consider opening a parallel discussion in one of the subreddits ([/r/mwo](https://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/), [/r/OutReachHPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG/)), or in the forum, which you can then link back the relevant issue here.
    * In the case of bugs, it provides more information about finding or fixing the bug.
    * In the case of enhancements/features:
        * It adds better context to the nature of the issue.
        * It helps refine the proposed change.
        * It points out potential upsides/downsides.
* Unhelpful comments like: "+1", "-1", "Yes!", "Nope", will be removed.
